<p><strong>King's Manor</strong> buildings are listed in their

<h2><a name="micklegate">Micklegate House</a></h2>

<p>Micklegate House stands at 88-90 Micklegate, near the centre of the city.
It was the original home of the Music Department, before they
moved onto campus and their <a href="buildings.html#music">own buildings.</a></p>

<p>The house was built by the noted architect John Carr (a York lad
himself) in 1753.  It was commissioned for the Bourchier family of
Beningbrough.</p>

<p>The University felt it no longer had a need for the building when
(Archaeology?) moved out in the early 90's, and put the building
up for sale, but no buyer was found and it remains in University hands.</p>

<h2><a name="stjohn">St John the Evangelist</a></h2>

<p>The church of St John the Evangelist, in Mickelgate, was built
c.1194 and much altered
in later years.  It closed in 1934, but was restored in 1956 by the York
Civic Trust for the Institiute of Advanced Architectural Studies (a 
forerunner of the University.)  It has since been further converted into
York Arts Centre.</p>

<h2><a name="anthony">St Anthony's Hall</a></h2>

<p>St Anthony's Hall stands in Peasholme Green, and is occupied by the
Borthwick Institute for Historical Research - part of the University.</p>

<p>The Hall was built in c.1453 for the social and religious guild of
St Anthony.  It was extended many times, notably during the late 15th
century, and during 1655-6 when the timber upper storey was replaced.
In the 17th century it became a house of correction, and in the 18th
century a school.  The Institute moved in during the 1950's.</p>
