King's Manor</h1>

<p>King's Manor, in the centre of the City, is one of the 
buildings used by the University since its early days.  The first buildings 
on the site were for the Abbot of the nearby St Mary's Abbey, and were
built in the 13th century.  There was rebuilding in the
15th century, and extensive repairs by the Earl of Sussex in 1568-70 during
it's use as the headquarters of the Council of
the North.  The Council arrived in 1539, and stayed for nearly
100 years until the Civil War.  Following the war, 
the Manor became a girls school, an elementary school, and then flats
for town councillors.  From 1833 the buildings were gradually taken over
by the School for the Blind, founded in memory of William Wilberforce.  The
headmasters house (designed by Walter Brierly in 1900) dates from this
period of occupation.</p>

<p>The University rented King's Manor from the owners, the York Corporation,
and moved in during 1964.  At that time the environment was described as a
``condition of considerable squalor'' (by Lord James) and much work was
needed on the fabric of the buildings.  A Victorian-age addition was demolished,
and the modern block of tutorial rooms were built.  The following
facts about the site are taken from the <a href="/factlist.html">York
Fact of the Day</a> service:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main building
was originally built as home for the Abbots of nearby St Mary's Abbey.</p>
<p>Although King's Manor has never been a Royal Residence, there are records
of Henry VIII, Charles I and II, and James VII of Scotland staying there.
Above the main door is the Royal Coat of Arms of Charles I, who moved
his court to York.</p>
<p>Students and visitors to King's Manor should keep watch for ghosts.
Manifestations include the sound of the groans of dying Roundheads after
an unsuccessful attack on the building on Trinity Sunday 1644; a woman
in Tudor dress suggested to be Anne Boleyn, who formed a relationship
with the manor's occupant while still married to Henry VIII; and more
recently, a portrait of a Stuart nobleman in the Huntingdon Room has
come to life and moved about the room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kings' Manor usually has a selection of sculptures on display - at the
time of writing these include a calf by Sally Arnup.</p>

<p>Conservation and conversion work on the buildings was planned by
Bernard Feilden, who later went on to supervise the rebuilding of
York Minster.</p>

<p>In the early years of the University, King's Manor was a social
focus of student life, especially the Cellars Club.  There
there were *rare* events in the cellars as late as 88-ish. (Probably
under the name the Zwiebelkeller -- ``Onion Cellar'').</p>

<p>King's Manor was completely re-roofed during 1988-91, at a cost of
&#163;750,000.</p>

<p>The grand Headmaster's House is home to the Centre for Medieval Studies,
who have always had a base at Kings Manor.  This item from the March 1995
issue of <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Medieval Studies moves house.</strong></p>

<p>The Centre for Medieval Studies, which has been based in the new block
of the King's Manor since its inception in the late 1960s, is moving in April
to the Headmaster's House on the same site.  This fine building, designed in 
the early years of the century by York architect Walter Brierly, will 
house ten members of staff from Art History, History and English, along
with secretary Louise Harrison.  The proximity of members of
the Archaeology Department, who are moving into the Centre's old premises
this summer, will offer new opportunities for even closer collaboration.</p>

<p>The Centre for Medieval Studies was started under the motivating force
of the late Elizabeth Salter, in association with Barry Dobson, Derek
Pearsall, Bunny Leff, Peter Rycraft, David Smith, Karen Hodder and the late
Peter Newton.  It flourished in the 1970's and early 1980's, but was
then affected by staff losses, by severe reductions in government funding
for humanities research and by competition from other universities.  
Reoganisation in the late 1980's, under Alistair Minnis (English), Edward 
James (History) and Martin Carver (Archaeology), gave the Centre new life,
and it has gone from strength to strength.  Two years ago Richard Marks was
appointed to the only chair in medieval stained glass in Britain.  This
year there are 33 MA students from six countries, and 16 graduates have
registered for higher degrees since 1991/2 when the interdisciplinary
MPhil/DPhil programme was started.  The students run a flourishing drama
group, the Lords of Misrule, which stages regular performances of
medieval plays.</p>

<p>Altogether 28 staff from the departments of Archaeology, Art History,
English and History are associated with the Centre.  The current director,
Edward James, is leaving to take up a chair in Medieval History at
Reading University in October, and he will be succeeded by Felicity
Riddy (English).  In the Headmaster's House the Centre will have two new
teaching rooms as well as space for specialist research projects.  This 
more spacious accommodation will help it maintain and enhance its
status as the country's most important interdisciplinary centre for
medieval studies.</p>
