<p>Although Heslington Hall dates from about 1565, most of the present building
was built in the 19th century. The hall was originally completed about 1568 for
Thomas Eynns, Secretary and Keeper of the Seal to the Council of the North.</p>

<p>It was rebuilt in 1852-5 for the owner,
Yarburgh Greame. The architect on this work was P.C. Hardwick, who
designed the Great Hall at Euston station.  The 
staircase towers are among remains of the original house).
The building and grounds were much admired, appearing in
Country Life 1900 and 1909 (in City Reference Library, Yorkshire Room).</p>

<p>The Yew alleys in the gardens of Heslington Hall were first planted in
about 1720. The bushes used to be pruned to the shape of chesspieces
back in Victorian times.  The sunken area near the modern lake used to be
a mirror pond, reflecting the gazebo.</p>

<p>During the Second World War, Heslington Hall became the headquarters of
4 Group, Bomber Command.</p>

<p>By the 1960's the hall was derelict.  The University took over the building
as it's headquarters in 1962.</p>
