<h3>Why is there a University of York?</h3>

<p>
In 1961 the Prime Minister appointed a Committee on Higher Education, to
be chaired by (Professor) Lord Robbins, who was Head of Economics at LSE.
The resulting <I>Robbins Report</I> of
1963 recommended a rapid and large expansion in the provision of higher
education in Britain, including the setting up of a number of new
universities.  Within 24 hours, the government had issued a White Paper
Accepting most of the recommendations of the Report.
As a result of this rapid and positive reaction, the establishment of a
university at York, which had been proposed for some time, came to fruition
in 1963.
</p><p>
But one recommendation, the broadening and extension of undergraduate
programmes from three years to four years, did not find favour - on grounds,
as ever, of cost.  This move had to wait for nearly twenty years, when
Manchester went ahead with the MPhys degree on their own initiative, to
everyone's ultimate benefit.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Why is there a Department of Computer Science at York?</h3>

<p>
'The cost of a medium sized computer is comparable with, for example, a
small nuclear accelerator or a radio-telescope.'
</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The <I>Flowers Report</I>, 1966
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this, but unconnected with it, the Government appointed a
Joint Working Group on Computers for Research, to be chaired by Professor
Flowers, Langworthy Professor of Physics at Manchester University.
The resulting <I>Flowers Report</I> was published in January 1966.
Other members of the group included Gordon Black (Professor of
Automatic Data Processing at Manchester), two other physicists, and two
people involved in scientific programming and computation.
</p><p>
Why was the Report commissioned?  The answer is that universities and
research councils were spending too little money on computers or on the
services that made them usable.  And why was that?
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>
     The sums of money involved were enormous in the context of the time:
     computers were very expensive, and research budgets were very small.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Computers were seen as instruments for research, almost all research
     money at that time came from the Government, and there was not much
     public money for research.  The University Grants Committee (UGC) was
     the quango that dispensed money to universities, and it had to adjudicate
     fairly among needs that far outstripped its resources.  The UGC worked
     through Five Year Plans ('quinquennia') that made rapid response almost
     impossible.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     The general public was prepared for money to be spent on teaching, but
     did not see the point of research.  The Government knew the importance
     of research, but had to tread carefully.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Within universities, governing bodies did not see the point of computers.
     They were appalled by the magnitude of the sums of money involved, and
     saw no benefit at all to non-(science and engineering) departments,
     who clearly did not need computers, nor any benefit to teaching - which
     clearly did not need computers.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
The Flowers Report recommended the setting up of large regional computing
centres in London, Manchester and Edinburgh, each of which should have a
CD 6800 or an IBM 360/92.  It noted that the otherwise largest computers
then being installed, at Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham,
Oxford and Salford (and later Newcastle), were the English Electric KDF9.
These machines were to be upgraded from 16k to 32k (48-bit) words.
</p><p>
(English Electric was a wide-ranging engineering firm that, among other
things, made the Lightning interceptor that held the world air speed record.
The KDF9 was a 'scientific' computer - as shown by the 'F' that meant it had
a floating-point unit: the KDP9 was for commercial data processing, and
didn't have one.)
</p><p>
Both Manchester (university, not regional centre) and Cambridge were rather
special cases, as they had long been in the business of designing and building
their own computers.  Indeed, the Flowers Report said that 'Our experience
is that efficient service . . . generally has to be backed up by a history
of computer development'.  But the world had moved on from 'If you want a
computer, build one', to 'If you want some software, write it'.
</p><p>
The Report then ran through a list of all Britain's universities.  Before
getting to York, try the following snippet concerning Exeter: 'The present
Elliott 803 seems to satisfy the needs of the University for some time'.
I myself used an Elliott 803, at Hatfield, in 1968-1970.  It was a
discrete-component germanium transistor machine, with serial processing
logic but a parallel core memory of 8k 40-bit words.  (It came with just 4k
if you chose not to pay to have it extended.)  Bit time 6 &mu;s, word time
288 &mu;s, add time 576 &mu;s.  The instruction set had been designed by a
student called Ian Barron (who later went on to design the transputer) during
a vacation from Cambridge, and the Algol compiler - the first ever - had been
written by Elliott's Chief Programmer, Tony Hoare (yes, that Professor
Sir Tony Hoare FRS).
</p><p>
The number of computers in a university at that time was typically 0 or 1.
Of Sussex: 'Neither the size of the University nor the nature of work
warrants the acquisition of the very large computer which they have requested.
It is felt, however, that that the University should not be left long without
some computer facility.'
</p><p>
Oh, and Keele: 'The University computer belongs to Professor McSweeney as
his private property. . .'
</p><p>
Of <B>York</B>, the Report said:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>
     The Working Group feels that the suggestion [previously] conveyed to them 
     that an Elliott 503 machine might be suitable for early installation is
     not a good one.  There is little evidence at present that there will be
     a heavy computing load in the near future but we acknowledge that a
     substantial load will eventually be built up at York and recommend the
     acquisition of an upgradeable Elliott 4100 series starting in 1965-66.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     The University [York] should report to the UGC on the state of their
     computation needs when this computer is commissioned, with a view to
     later upgrading.  In the meantime we suggest that they work in
     collaboration with Leeds and Manchester.
 </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The Elliott 503 was a re-design of the 803: but this time with silicon
transistors and parallel logic.  It was notoriously un-upgradeable.
The Elliott 4100 series, however, was designed with upgradeability as its
USP: but, of the proposed 4110, 4120, 4130, ... only the 4120 and 4130
saw the light of day.  The few 4120s produced did not have hardware
floating point.  The 4150, which
York had hoped to move on to, was never produced.  What York got was a
4130, and very good it was too, for its time.
</p><p>
Notice, by the way, the sheer number of computer manufacturers involved.
It was a clearly stated aim of the Flowers Report to spread the load, so
that no one manufacturer should have its production capacity over-taxed.
Delays of a year or two between order and delivery were not uncommon -
and that at a time when designs were going seriously out of date in two
or three years.  And not only were the offerings from different manufacturers
incompatible with one another, but successive models from one manufacturer
were usually incompatible with one another: the idea of a 'series' (IBM 360,
Elliott 4100) had only just started.  That was important, as most code
was still written in assembly language (i.e., effectively, machine code).
</p><p>
The Flowers Report recommended a total expenditure of &pound;18 million
over the quinquennium 1965-1970: &pound;12 million on British equipment and
&pound;6 million on American.  There were no other realistic contenders
(Japan did not make computers) and British public money was directed to
British suppliers except in cases where they did not offer anything large
enough, or did not have the production capacity.  Only a few years earlier,
the most powerful computer in the world had been the Ferranti Atlas - the
result of a collaboration between Manchester University and the Manchester
electrical engineering firm Ferranti, that had started in 1945 when
personnel had been released from war work.  Some US government 'agencies'
had been keen to buy the Atlas - and had been visited by Professors Kilburn
and Williams - but Ferranti had been reluctant to accept orders beyond their
capacity to manufacture or, more pertinently, to maintain and service at
such a distance.  Cambridge University was fobbed off with a cut-down Atlas,
called Titan, on grounds of cost; and this was later replaced by an IBM 360.
It was a different world.

<h3>The fight for recognition</h3>

<p>
It is difficult now to realise the difficulties that the Department had
in it early days to obtain recognition of its needs, or even of its
right to exist <I>as an academic department</I>.
</p><p>
It can well be asked: if the University did not want a Department of
Computer Science, why did it set one up in the first place?  The answer is,
that it didn't.  It was offered a 'Department of Computation' or, as it
could have been called at the time, a Computer Centre with associated
support and service teaching.  What it got was a cuckoo in the nest.
Ten years later, it had a very successful Computing Service; and also a
very successful Department of Computer Science.  But the birth had been
painful for all concerned.
</p><p>
To understand why this should have been so, and also why it should have been
so in such an extreme way, it is necessary to appreciate the cultural
environment of the time - something little recorded and now slipping from
memory.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The cultural background - disdain for machinery</h3>

<p>
In 1980, Richard Feynman went to the Archaeological Museum in Athens, to
look at the Antikythera mechanism: a remarkable calculator/computer survival.
The knowledge, now, of its existence in 100 BC has enormous implications for
the history of ideas.  Response from curator: 'Why are you only interested in
machinery, when there are all these statues?'
</p><p>
In the mid-1970s, a senior member of this Department had a rewarding
discussion with a senior member of the University administration who told
him that Computer Science was not a proper academic discipline any more
than Lawnmower Science would be.  The trouble with assertions like that is
the number of unspoken assumptions in the statement that have to be
disposed of even before the substance of the statement can be addressed.
And also, of course, the fact that Computer Science is not science: it
is engineering.  (This last point is essential if the lawnmower heresy
is to be dealt with.)
</p><p>
In the 1950s, the Princeton Institute of Advanced Studies were appalled by
John von Neumann's attempts to install on site some computer hardware that
was under development.  Contrast that with the open-mindedness of King's
College Cambridge, fifteen years earlier, when Alan Turing got the Mechanical
Engineering workshops to make him some gear wheels with prime numbers of
teeth in an ultimately hopeless (and uncompleted) project to detect
counter-examples to the Riemann hypothesis.
</p><p>
Back to the lawnmowers.  That people were so ignorant and lacking in
imagination is not reprehensible.  They were ignorant (factually and not
pejoratively) simply because computers and computer science were so new.
Computers were far more new, to far more people, than it is now easy to
believe.  The people concerned were lacking in imagination only because
they were not used to being imaginative about machinery.
They could not see that the use
of some machinery can be unbounded, and that that use can be a respectable
academic pursuit: but also they could not see that the invention and
design of machinery, and the co-operation between design and requirement,
each feeding off the other, are creative and mentally stimulating
activities - that these can be academic pursuits also.
</p><p>
Edsger Dijkstra's snide comment that 'Computer Science is no more about
computers than Astronomy is about telescopes' is dangerous both because it
is just a tiny bit true and also because it is almost entirely false -
with the wit of the statement amplifying the true aspect while distracting
us from its predominant falsity.
</p><p>
It did make the work of establishing the Department an uphill task.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The cultural background - state versus process</h3>

<p>
This is not concerned with Computer Science alone.  It is to do with any
intellectual or technical activity.  Specifically: there is a tendency to
see what you know about as a process, and what you <I>think</I> you know
about as a state.  In a world, and at a time, when not many people actually
knew much about computers, they were accepted as they were and there was
little questioning of where they - or the engineering of their hardware
and software - came from.

<h3>1975 - a Snapshot</h3>

<p>
The year 1975 saw the first issue of the Computer Science
Students' Handbook.  It is therefore the first year for which we
now have detailed information.
</p><p>
Here is exactly how it describes the Board of Studies:
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Dr I C Wand (Chairman)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr W Freeman (Secretary)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Prof I C Pyle (Head of Department)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr D G Burnett-Hall</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr A J Bullen</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr C J Tully</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Dr A J Willmott</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Dr D Orr (Dept of Physics)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The reason that David Orr was a member of our BoS is that he taught and
examined a significant part of our programme at that time: we had not yet set
up our own hardware teaching labs, and also we were under pressure for
teaching and examining manpower, so Physics provided us with hardware teaching
labs and a lecturer/examiner for our digital systems design module.
(The Department of Electronics did not yet exist.)
It had always been our policy to include computer hardware in our teaching
and research, alongside software, theory and applications.  In that, we were
unusual if by no means alone - and it served us well.
</p><p>
Notable students at the time included:
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Second year:</td><td>Andrew [sic] Wellings</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Third year:</td><td>Colin Runciman</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
     <td>MPhil year 1:&nbsp;</td><td>Alan Burns</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Returning to the Board of Studies notice that, although three members
(Burnett-Hall, Bullen, Willmott) had qualifications in numerical computation,
not one member had any formal qualification of any kind in Computer Science.
All had come into Computer Science from other fields, which accounted for
the small number with PhDs.  Also, note that, unlike many Computer Science
departments at the time, it was not the case that almost all were
mathematicians: the Department's tradition of containing a stiffening of
ex-physicists had started even then.  The (early) career histories of the
CS members were as follows.
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Ian Wand</td>
     <td>Leicester (Physics), IBM Hursley</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Bill Freeman</td>
     <td>Leeds (Physics), Hatfield Polytechnic Computer Centre</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Ian Pyle</td>
     <td>Cambridge (Physics),
         Atomic Energy Research Establishment Harwell</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>David Burnett-Hall&nbsp;</td>
     <td>Cambridge (Mathematics),
         Royal Aircraft Establishment Farnborough</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Tony Bullen</td>
     <td>York (Mathematics, Numerical Computation)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Colin Tully</td>
     <td>Cambridge (Economics),
         London School of Economics, LEO Computers</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>John Willmott</td>
     <td>Manchester (Mathematics, Computation),
         British Iron and Steel Research Association</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
It was the task of the Secretary to edit the Students' Handbook.  It was
written in longhand, typed on electric! typewriters by the secretarial
staff, iterated until correct, and then sent on A4 sheets for printing.
At no stage was any of the text stored or processed by artficial means.
</p><p>
As an indication of the size of the University at that time: most members of
staff had three-digit telephone numbers.  A few had four digits, all beginning
with '5' to use the recent expansion of the exchange.
