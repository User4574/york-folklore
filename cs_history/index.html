<title>UoY DoCS History - Preface and Index</title>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>History of the Department of Computer Science at York</h1>

<h2>Preface and Index</h2>

<p>
This is an index to a first draft of a History of the Department of Computer
Science at the University of York.  It has been commissioned by John McDermid.
</p><p>
The site is edited by Bill Freeman.  As a matter of policy, each
page has a clearly identified author (or compiler, etc.).
</p><p>
There will eventually be contributions from several past and present members
of the Department; but, at the present date, very helpful assistance concerning
the earliest days has been received from John Willmott and Ian Wand.
Ian Wand has also embarked on a systematic search of the University archives.
</p><p>
All contributions, memories, corrections, etc., will be gratefully received.
</p><p>
The History will appear in web form, nicely set out, with pictures.  The
present draft is in minimal-tech html, with the emphasis on inclusion of
information and speed of presentation.  It will be for others to prettify:
suggestions about that also gratefully received.
</p><p>
<I>
These pages are being filled merely as information becomes available, and not
according to my (or anybody's) idea of order of relative importance.

<h3>Research groups - active in 2011</h3>

<p>
In the earliest days, each member of academic staff had 'research interests' -
perhaps more than one each.  Later, with collaboration on grant-supported
research, they were identified with 'research projects' - again, perhaps more
than one.
Later still, influenced by advice from external research assessment panels,
they were assembled into 'research groups' - or, rather, most of the
Department's research work was classified according to groups, with any
individual sometimes being a member of more than one group.
</p> <p>
That meant that some groups were closely focussed on a shared goal, while
others were flags of convenience - perhaps flown by sub-groups, or even
individuals, who had clearly indentified goals of their own but usefully
shared in the loose grouping.
</p> <p>
As an example, several members in the early days were interested in
programming languages and systems; this widened to include the 'software
technology' of the 'systems' part.  Then, software technology became known as
software engineering.  Ultimately, the interests in programming languages,
and the software engineering of large systems - of which compilers and
run-time systems were a significant example - diverged.  There arose a
research group specifically in Software Engineering (SWE).  That group no
longer exists, but its history can be found in the narrative pages.
Also, there arose a group specifically in Programming Languages and Systems:
this happens to be one of those groups that is a loose assembly of members
with shared interests.  It is listed below along with all the other groups
that still exist, with their names exactly as they appear in the
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/research/research-groups/">
Research Groups page</a> in the Department's web site.

These groupings are not fixed for all time: for example, the AI group was
formed in 1999 by the merger of the two former groups Intelligent Systems
and Machine Learning.
