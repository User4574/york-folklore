<h3>1. Main University Computers</h3>
</p>

<p>
<h4>1.0 Prehistory - computers large and small</h4>
</p>

<p>
During the 1940s and 1950s, it became possible to construct very large
electronic machines.  Some of these were calculators; and some of them
were computers.  Earlier, in the 1930s, automatic telephone exchanges
had been the largest information processing machines in use on the
planet, but they were electro-mechanical.  Electronic machines, by contrast,
tended then to be small (e.g. radios) because anything with a large number
of electron tubes was considered, potentially, too unreliable.  (<I>Electron
tube</I> is the currently preferred term for the former UK <I>valve</I>
and US <I>vacuum tube</I>.)  When Colossus was constructed at Bletchley Park
in the 1940s, it was easily the largest <I>electronic</I> machine on Earth,
and it convinced those who knew about it that such machines were feasible,
in that that they would not keep breaking down all the time: an important
step for the future of computers.
</p> <p>
Machines of the size of Colossus - electro-mechanical in the 1930s and 1940s,
and electronic in the 1940s and 1950s - were typically arranged as several
bays of racking (each bay being filled with chassis filled with circuitry)
and a fringe of smaller pieces of equipment, such as teleprinters, standing
around it and connected to it by wires.
As a convenient way of referring to things, the central racking came to be
called the <I>main frame</I>, while the fringe came to be called the
<I>peripheral devices</I>.  In time, these became <I>mainframe</I> and
<I>peripherals</I>.
</p> <p>
With the ousting of electron tubes by transistors in the late 1950s, and of
discrete transistors by integrated circuits in the late 1960s, computers
became smaller.  Then, computers that were still large enough to require
bays of racking became called <I>mainframe computers</I>.  Smaller ones,
with just one bay (but not up to the ceiling) were called
<I>minicomputers</I>.
During the 1970s, there came large scale integration (LSI), and a processor
all on one chip - hence <I>microcomputers</I>.  By the 1980s, you could fit
a computer into a washing machine - whereas, in the 1950s, you could easily
have fitted a washing machine into a computer.
</p> <p>
Now, in the 21st century, a computer can be powerful without necessarily
being large.  These terms are relative, of course: a <I>supercomputer</I>
used for weather forecasting will be physically large - a <I>mainframe</I>
computer if you like - but central computers serving networks are powerful
without being remarkably large, even those that serve up simple processing
power, and we now call these just <I>servers</I>, not mainframes.

<h4>1.1 The Elliott (later ICL) 4130</h4>
</p>

<p>
The University opened its first computer room - large and air-conditioned -
in July 1967.
Into it came the University's first computer: an Elliott 4130.
The building had been funded, and the computer had been funded and chosen,
by the Computer Board for England and Wales - see the
<a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~wf/history/N-60-79.html">
Narrative page for 1960-79</a>.
</p> <p>
As delivered, the 4130 had 16k words of core memory (32 bits per word).
It had a fast paper tape reader and a fast paper tape punch, for the
input and output of data.
It had a rather slow card reader for the input of programs.  (It did not
have a card punch - these were not common, as they were expensive to buy,
to service, and to run.)
It had a few (two? three?) magnetic tape handlers, of somewhat low
specification.
</p> <p>
It had absolutely no on-line access of any kind.  Indeed, as evidence of its
isolation, the only electrical connections between it and the outside world
were the three-phase power cables laid in a trench in the surrounding concrete.
</p> <p>
In September 1967, its memory was upgraded to 32k.
</p> <p>
In January 1969, at a cost of &pound;50,257, it acquired three disc
handlers.  These held 'exchangeable disc packs' - the operator could stop
the handler running, open the lid of the cabinet, unlock the disc pack, and
carry it (it was heavy) to a rack; then take up a different one, carry it
across, lock it in place, close the lid, and press the 'run-up' button.
Each exchangeable disc pack held one megaword (4 megabytes).
</p> <p>
On 6 March 1970, a fourth disc handler was added, and the memory was
replaced by a faster, larger one of 64k, which remained for the duration.
This upgrade also included eight teletype-33 ASR on-line
interactive 'consoles'.

<h4>1.3 The computer replacement process</h4>
</p>

<p>
Following the invitation to bid, there were the following contenders.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     Burroughs&nbsp;&nbsp;***
     </B>
     </p><p>
     Burroughs offered the model 5500 (or 6500?).  These seemed at first
     to be architecturally advanced: they were designed to have virtual
     memory right from the start, they handled parallel processes elegantly
     and efficiently (the instruction set operated on a cactus stack), all
     systems software was written in a high level language (a suitably
     modified version of <I>Algol</I>: even the Fortran compiler was
     written in <I>Algol</I>), it could handle a very
     large number of on-line interactive terminals, and so on.
     But it had some serious disadvantages.
     </p><p>
     It was really a transaction-processing system.  It was designed to
     operate in an environment where almost all the terminals interacted
     with one executing program (or possibly two or three).  That is, in
     an application such as airline seat reservation, or theatre ticket
     booking.  Only a few 'systems' terminals had the privilege of being
     able to create, modify and delete files, compile programs, and
     execute object code created by the on-line user.  The Burroughs people
     did not at first understand what we would regard as normal interactive
     use, and were baffled even when we had explained it.
     </p><p>
     The other disadvantage, that spoke of its background in commercial
     data processing, was that its disc memory was a simulation of 80-column
     punched cards.  Each byte represented a column, and all 80 columns
     were respesented on disc even when they were space characters (in
     card-speak: 'blanks').  In its intended application involving a uniform
     sequence of commercial records, that made sense; but when, as in
     university use, most lines consisted of just a few characters terminated
     with 'end-of-line' (a concept unknown to the card-based file store), it
     meant that 95% of the disc represented blanks.  That was at a time when
     discs were very expensive, slow, and physically large but logically small.
     </p><p>
     A certain British university from the 1960s opted for one of these
     systems and found out afterwards.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     Digital Equipment Corporation
     </B>
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     General Electric&nbsp;&nbsp;***
     </B>
     </p><p>
     (This was US General Electric, not UK General Electric Company).
     </p><p>
     There is now no memory of what they were offering.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     International Business Machines
     </B>
     </p><p>
     IBM were offering one of the 370 series.
     To some extent, this system had the same disadvantages as the Burroughs
     offering.
     </p><p>
     IBM put up the backs of the Department's internal committee, and to
     some extent of CSAC, by refusing to talk to anyone 'technical' but
     sending people in suits and white shirts to talk about money with
     the Vice-Chancellor.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     ICL (2900 series)

     </p><p>
     2900 series
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
     <B>
     Rank Xerox Data Systems&nbsp;&nbsp;***
     </B>
     </p><p>
     This was the computer-services subsidiary of the (UK) Rank Corporation
     that used, and marketed, US Xerox Data Systems computer systems.  It
     was US XDS that withdrew from the computer manufacturing market.
 </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<B>***</B> During the months when the University was considering these
bids, the three suppliers 'starred' above withdrew from the computer
manufacturing market - not just from our requirement, but globally, suddenly
and completely.

KSR = keyboard send/receive was an input device (keyboard) and an output
device (teleprinter) operating fully duplex using two twisted pairs at
110 baud.  With an 11-bit frame containing 8 data bits, that gave 10
ASCII characters per second.  ASR = automatic send/receive had an extension
bolted on the side that could read and punch 8-hole paper tape as if from
the keyboard or to the teleprinter.

Just for the record, these are straight out of the Students' Handbooks.
All that have been changed, for brevity, are (1) use of SWTL and HWTL
instead of longer descriptions, and omission of local names of servers.
