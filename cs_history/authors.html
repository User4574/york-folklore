<h3>Guidelines for authors of sections of the History of the Department</h3>

<ul>
 <li><p>
     Each section will have a clearly identified author.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     The author of each section will be responsible for its content and,
     to a large extent, for its approach, structure, level of detail
     and so on.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Please write in the first person, vividly.  That is, 'I first heard
     about X in the year 1984', rather than 'The present author first
     heard about X . . .'
     </p><p>
     Later generations can scan through the files, read the textbooks, etc.,
     but only you can provide personal reminiscences.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Prefer the active to the passive: 'We carried out this project . . .',
     rather than 'This project was carried out by us . . .'
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Speed is of the essence.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     If speed imposes brevity, no matter: brief content can be expanded
     at a later date.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     If speed causes errors, no matter: what is wrong can be put right later
     on.
     </p><p>
     Once content is submitted to public scrutiny it is more likely that
     errors will be spotted (and so corrected) than that absence of material
     will be noticed (and so filled).
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Bear in mind that, for certain facts, you might be the only person to
     know them; and could be the last person ever to know them.  So, feel
     free to include lists and tables of data, for the benefit of future
     historians.
     </p><p>
     To give yourself freedom of manoeuvre, consider having some sections
     that are clearly intended to be 'boring but important', balanced by
     others that are gripping but barely relevant.  Each can, when you
     wish, then be an extreme example of its own kind.
     </p></li>
 <li><p>
     Feel free to provide a concise entry that makes much use of references
     to other pages: group membership, research projects, research grants,
     lists of publications, and so on.
     </p><p>
     There is no point in duplicating what already exists; but in cases where
     you consider that an existing specialist page needs to be re-written
     for a 'history' readership, consider referring to the page as it
     exists, now, for the sake of speed, and provide the re-written version
     later.
     </p></li>
</ul>
