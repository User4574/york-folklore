Since its foundation, the Department has repeatedly moved into a new
building - possibly designed to fit its requirements in kind if not in size -
and then outgrown it.  It has then set up outposts around the
University site, at some cost through inconvenience.  It has then
been granted a new building possibly designed to fit its requirements
in kind if not in size - with minimal thought to further expansion.

<h3>1. Old X/A and X/B Blocks</h3>

<p>
In 1966, the Flowers Report gave a strong hint - backed up by money
conditional upon taking the hint - about what a 'Computation' building should
be like, in terms of the accommodation for people and machines, and for users
of the service, that were required.
(In those days, 'the computer' did not come to the people: the people came to
the computer.)
</p> <p>
Our initial accommodation consisted of two 'Clasp' blocks, either side
of the footpath that runs up the hill from Vanbrugh to the Library bridge.
The Vanbrugh College buildings were then two or three years old, the Library
a year older, and the Library bridge a year older than that.  The 'Student
Services' building, now just north of Vanbrugh, was not built until some
twenty years later, and the present Environment building ten years after that.
It is not known why the Computation buildings straddled the footpath.  It
was inconvenient, and brought no discernible benefit.
</p> <p>
X/A block was a single-storey building consisting of a small lecture room,
a reading room (called the 'library' but containing no books), a small
staff common room that was also used for staff meetings and the first
meetings of the Board of Studies, a Director's room with secretarial office
en suite, and seven staff offices.
X/A block was eventually demolished to make way for the Market Square
building, and was where Costcutters now is.
</p> <p>
X/B block was a single-storey building consisting principally of an
air-conditioned computer room with a high ceiling.  It also contained a
card-punch room, a rest room for the computer and card-punch operators,
and a room near the door equipped with pigeon-holes where users from around
the University would come and go to deposit and collect their 'jobs' that
were dealt with by batch processing.
</p> <p>
In X/A block, David Burnett-Hall occupied the Director's room.  There was
just one secretary to handle all the activities of the entire Department.  
Of the seven staff offices, four were occupied by academic staff - two
lecturers and two (permanent) fellows - and one by the Computer Manager,
Peter Roberts.  Of the remaining two, one was occupied by David Hardcastle,
the University's Data Processing Officer.  He was a member of the Bursar's
Department (now the Finance and Facilities Management departments), and was
responsible for all those operations of the University administration that
had been computerised: that meant, money, but not yet students: no one in
the Registrar's Department had yet seen a computer.
The final office was called the 'Calculator Room' and contained three
electromechanical calculators: donated, for general use, by science
departments who had no further use for them.  It was the end of an era.
</p>

<h4>1.1 Our complete occupation of X/A block</h4>

<p>
Gradual expansion of the Department resulted in David Hardcastle moving
to Heslington Hall, and the electromechanical calculators going to a rest
home, to make way for new staff: Ian Wand and Colin Tully.
Ian Pyle arrived as our first Professor and became Head of Department.
David Burnett-Hall, as Reader, took over the common room as his office.
The department library, which was larger, became also our common room and
meeting room.
</p>

<h4>1.2 Our temporary accommodation in Langwith</h4>

<p>
Our first two research students, Steve Bostock and John Jones (1973-1977),
required somewhere to sit, and so took over an office in Langwith D block.
</p>

<h4>1.3 Our first temporary accommodation in Wentworth</h4>

<p>
In 1975, John Willmott moved, with his research group, into converted
residential accommodation in Wentworth C block.  Colin Tully also moved
there before moving to Physics . . .
</p>

<h4>1.4 Our temporary accommodation in Physics</h4>

<p>
The successor to the Flowers Committee was the Computer Board for England
and Wales, a quango that ensured that universities spent some money on what
had become called computer centres, and gave them the money to enable that
to happen.  In 1974, the Computer Board announced that a number of university
computer centres were to have extensions built.  York was one of them.  The
plan was to extend X/B block northwards.  That did indeed happen - it is still
there, and you can go and look at - but, at a late stage in the design there
was a sterling crisis and one metre was sliced out of each of the extensions
due to be built in England (though not, for electoral reasons, those in Wales).
To enable these building works to take place, the Computing Service (as it
had by then become - now IT Services) moved its staff into some X/A block
offices, with its punch card room moving into our small lecture room.
</p> <p>
In 1975, to make room, three lecturers (Bill Freeman, Colin Tully and Bill
Freeman) moved offices into temporary accommodation in the Physics building.
We were able to have a medium-sized room for a group of research students
and research assistants, and also a larger room
as our first proper research laboratory - it contained a DEC PDP-11 for
general-purpose software research (the result of a grant obtained by Ian
Wand and Ian Pyle) and a GT40 vector graphics computer, as well as the
nucleus of our present hardware workshops and research areas.
</p> <p>
When the building of the Computing Service building was complete, we were
able to take over the older, southern, part of X/B block and move our
research laboratories into the old Service computer room.  Our academic staff
offices also came back from Physics, some back into X/A block, and others
elsewhere.
</p> <p>
Verbatim from the Computer Science Students' Handbook for 1976:
<I>The new building to house the DECsystem-10 computer, having been delayed
by the government cuts before those before last, will not be ready until
April.  At that point, the DECsystem-10 will be moved to the new computer
room and the old computer room will become the Computer Science Research
Laboratory.  The card punches and terminals will move to their new home,
allowing the Computer Science Lecture Room to be just that again; and the
Computer Science Departmental Library will be relieved of the Computing
Advisory Service and such like.</I>
</p>

<h4>1.5 Our temporary accommodation in Chemistry</h4>

<p>
In 1980, Ian Wand moved his research group into temporary accommodation in
the Chemistry buildings (C/D block), where a 'server room' as we would now
call it (but didn't then) was established, containing a large VAX-11 system.
He was then joined by the newly-appointed Keith Mander.
In 1982, they all (except the VAX-11) moved across to C/A block, as a result
of a serious fire in Chemistry.  (No, not us.)
</p>

<h4>1.6 Our temporary accommodation in Language</h4>

<p>
Even that was not enough.
We needed several new offices.  The Department of Language and Linguistics
needed a few.  So their building (Z building) acquired a new extension
(Z/A block) in which we occupied a new departmental office, a new
professorial suite, a seminar/meeting room, and about six new academic
staff offices.  (Z/A now contains the University's Careers Service; the main
Z building was overbuilt by the Berrick Saul Building.)
</p> <p>
Most of X/A block was converted into hardware and software teaching labs,
hardware workshops, a Chief Technician's room (Peter Cooper), and store rooms.
</p>

<h4>1.7 Our temporary teaching accommodation in Vanbrugh</h4>

<p>
The number of undergraduate computer terminals had to increase significantly,
and we needed somewhere to put them.
Also, we needed a new name for where they were put.  'Computer room' was
out: for one thing, these were just dumb lines-of-text screens, even if
they did have direct cursor addressing; no images; a keyboard, yes, but no
mouse.  For another, 'computer room' meant then what we now call a 'server
room'.  One alternative was 'terminal room', but that seemed a bit extreme.
</p> <p>
We settled on 'software teaching laboratory' (software lab, for short).  So
one of these remained in X/A001 (the old lecture room, long ago, of the
Department of 'Computation'), and we also had a new one in V/044 (later
to move to V/058, which was bigger).
</p> <p>
That is how we were - in X/A and the original part of X/B block, in Z/A
block, in Chemistry and in Vanbrugh - when we were planning a whole new
building: X/D block.
</p>

<h4>1.8 A Snapshot: 1984</h4>

<p>
Future historians, trying to track research groups, etc., may be interested
in the fact that the Student's Handbook of 1984 records locations before
and after the intended move 'due in March 1985'.  If you have ever tried
to work out what happened before what, you will know what I mean.
(Telephone numbers and precise room numbers have been omitted, to save you
and me pain.  Also, all occurrences of 'Ms', etc., have been omitted.)

<h3>2. Old X/D Block</h3>

<p>
In 1985, we were given a new building.  This was the first building
designed for our purposes.  Previously, we had expanded into existing but
converted accommodation; or accommodation that, even if newly built, was
intended as temporary housing for only part of the Department.
</p> <p>
Into X/D block, there moved: Ian Benest, Jim Briggs, David Burnett-Hall,
Bill Freeman, Michael Harrison, Keith Mander, Gary Morgan, Colin Runciman,
Harold Thimbleby, Colin Tully, Ian Wand, Andy Wellings, Dick
Whittington and John Willmott.
(John Willmott also retained, for some time before and after this move, an
experimental control systems laboratory in Physics P/S021.)
Ian Pyle, still occupying a Chair in the
Department, remained in the Computing Service building X/B.
</p> <p>
In X/B055, the old 'Computation' computer room, we had a computer room
attended to by Anne Benninger, a member of our hardware support staff:
this housed hands-on research computers and also the servers for the
undergraduate software laboratories.
Our other hardware support staff (Rick Pack, Peter Cooper, Gurmit Singh and
Vivienne Wilson) remained in X/A; while
software support staff (Charles Forsyth, David Snowden and John Murdie)
moved into X/D.  Valerie Fry - now Atkinson - led the administrative team
(Angela Fairclough and Jenny Turner) also in X/D.
</p> <p>
X/D block could not hold the whole of the Department, just most of it,
but it did provide us with a nucleus: central administrative offices;
fifteen academic staff offices with adjacent space for research students,
staff and equipment; offices for software support; a library; a reasonable
common room; and new hardware teaching labs for first and second years.
That meant that the hardware
teaching labs were, for the first time, very well housed: but the software
teaching labs remained in X/A001 and V/044: adequate, but only just, and
they remained only adequate until our later move into CS building.
(The problem was that you could put software labs just about anywhere, on
the end of pieces of wire; but you could not do that with hardware labs:
you either had them near essential services or did not have them at all.)
</p> <p>
A LOT MORE TO GO HERE.
</p>

<h4>2.1 Our temporary research accommodation in Vanbrugh</h4>

<p>
Further pressure on staff and research space entailed an expansion into
converted residential accommodation in Vanbrugh: V/X block.  (This block has
since been truncated to allow for the construction of the Information Centre
in Market Square, and given the new name 'Grimston House'.)
</p> <p>
Two groups moved into V/X: an AI group; and also a new Management group.
The former included Fiona Polack.
The latter was led
by Alan Sanders, who held a joint appointment between us and Electronics.
</p>

<h4>2.2 Our temporary accommodatuion in X/D block car park</h4>

<p>
In 19xx, a two-storey Portakabin building was erected in X/D block car park,
to house the High-Integrity Systems Engineering (HISE) group, led by John
McDermid.
</p>

<h4>2.3 Our second temporary accommodation in Wentworth</h4>

<p>
Late in 1995, the establishment of MSc Safety-Critical Systems Engineering
meant that further staff/research/teaching accommodation was required.  So,
the Department expanded into a part of Wentworth College which had just been
vacated by the Department of Psychology (which had just moved into a large
new building near what is now James College).  This new venture was to
provide one-week modules for a taught MSc programme designed to attract
students mainly seconded for short periods (a week or two) from industry.
</p> <p>
The accommodation consisted of a lecture room, three staff offices, a
support office and a staff common room.
This continued to be used by the Department - with the addition of another
MSc programme, in Software Engineering - until the move into CS Building.
</p>

<h4>2.4 Our temporary accommodation in X/E block</h4>

<p>
In between Vanbrugh College and what is now IT Services lies a single-storey
building, adjacent to the covered way, and now used for Student Services.
</p> <p>
That was where the High Integrity Systems Engineering group expanded into,
from X/D block.  This group included John McDermid, Jim Briggs,
</p> <p>
This building was designed specifically for the Department's expansion, and
we were involved in the process.  After the design was costed, but
before construction went to tender, it became apparent that it would come in
under budget.  We asked if the two sides (with offices) could be pulled apart
by one metre, giving a larger central research area.  That was done within
the budget, and that was the way it was built.  Could such a thing happen now?
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. CS Building, next to the Library</h3>

<p>
By the year 19XX, we were divided among nine distinct locations around the
University site.  We were all brought together for the first time - if not
for long - in the 'CS' building.  (The University had to be persuaded to
release the designation 'CS' from the Cricket Store on 22 acres playing
field; and, no, that is not a joke.)
</p> <p>
A LOT MORE TO GO HERE.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. CSE Building, at Heslington East</h3>

<p>
In 2010, we moved into a new building, once again designed to suit our
requirements; and, once again, designed to hold all the Department.
Actually, not all of it: intentionally, those members with a
'interdisciplinary' bent were located in the Ron Cook Hub: a multi-purpose
building just across the path.  By the time we moved in, this had been
supplemented by robotics research laboratory just around the corner.
</p> <p>
What we mainly moved into was CSE building: officially Computer Science East,
but colloqually and usefully known Computer Science and Engineering building.
</p>

<p>
A LOT MORE TO GO HERE
</p>

<h4>4.1 Our accommodation in the Ron Cooke Hub</h4>

<p>
A LOT MORE TO GO HERE
</p>

<h4>4.2 Our robotics lab building at Heslington East</h4>

<p>
Even before we moved in, we had expanded.  Next to CSE building lies TFTB
building, which houses the Department's robotics lab ('Rob Lab').
This purpose-built lab houses a workshop, a public viewing gallery and a
90-square-metre arena for robotic experiments.
</p> <p>
Jon Timmis has provided the following details.  'The robot lab supports
research into autonomous robotic systems ranging from individual and swarm
land-based robots to underwater swarm robotics.  The lab is owned by the
Non-Standard Computation (NSC) group but supports activities across a range
of groups within the Department and the York Centre for Complex Systems
Analysis (YCCSA).  Undergraduates and masters students also have access to
the lab to support project work in the area of robotics, and in the medium
term a new MSc in Autonomous Robotics is planned between the departments of
Computer Science and Electronics.  The lab houses suitable infrastructure
for the support of robotic experiments, and a range of land-based swarm
robots, 2 larger land-based robots (one suitable for outside use),
2 quad-rotor flying robots, a 6-rotor flying robot and a water tank for
underwater robotics work.'
