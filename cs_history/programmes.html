This table lists all taught programmes: graduate MSc, and undergraduate
MEng, BEng, BSc and BA.
</p> <p>
For historical accuracy, note that the original 'Computation' soon gave
way to 'Computer Science'.  Also, in the first few years taught graduate
degrees used to be BPhil and all undergraduate degrees were BA.
This Department was a party to a campaign to introduce MSc and BSc; that
was successful.  Then, this Department was the first to introduce
accredited engineering programmes: these were MEng and BEng (but see note
at end).
The original terminology has been used here only for the very earliest
years, as the details of the changeover are now lost.
</p> <p>
At some time after the move from BA to BSc, but before the introduction of
MEng and BEng, this department was the first to introduce industrial
placement years ('sandwich years' as they were then called).
</p> <p>
A new programme goes through the phases: proposal; approval; and then, for
the first time each: appearance in official catalogues and prospectuses,
advertising, application, selection, interview, admission, entry, study,
assessment, graduation.  Of all these phases, it is the first <I>entry</I>,
i.e. the first actual <I>intake</I>, that is noted here.
</p> <p>
<I>
Note that often, in order to get a new programme off the ground with a
prototyping intake, some of our current students
on an existing programme would transfer into a new programme a year or
two before its intake from outside the University.  In those cases, the date
of that intake by internal transfer is recorded here.

<p>
Following the publication of the Finniston Report <I>Engineering our
Future</I> in 1981, we introduced a four-year integrated degree designated
BEng, and planned an extension year designated MEng, both as recommended in
that Report.  It soon became apparent to all universities that applicants
were reluctant to apply for a four-year bachelor's degree, and so these
two degrees were re-designated MEng (nationwide) and EngDip (Engineering
Diploma - at least, at York) respectively.  The designation BEng was then
used (generally) for three-year accredited engineering degrees.
