<h2>    <a name="fulford">Fulford Road</a></h2>

<p>The University seem to be stuck for a name for this student residence, forcing
those who live there to invent their own.  As part of York's drive to increase the
number of people living in the centre of York, and the University's to provide
more accomodation, a network of 16 rooms were converted above Jacksons supermarket
in Fulford.  As with many such conversions, the size of rooms varies, with some huge
and some not so huge.  Let to undergraduates.  Quite handy for town.</p>

<p>There is now a second set of rooms in Fulford Road, at 65/67  - see <a href="#latest">latest news</a> for details.</p>

<p>11 single rooms, close to town.  Let to undergraduates, especially finallists.</p>

<p>Another set of accomodation over a supermarket, Jacksons in Bishopthorpe Road.  It opened
in January 1996, as mentioned in the February 1996 <i>Grapevine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Students housed over the shop in city centre</strong></p>
<p>University of York student housing developed in Scarcroft Road was ready for
occupation at the beginning of term.  This was the latest in a scheme called
`Living Over the Shop' which aims to convert the unused spaces above shops into
accomodation.  The Scarcroft Road site was the premises of a former Co-op store
which had been empty for over 20 years and still housed the winch for lifting
flour into the bakery.</p>
<p>The LOTS organisation has been based at King's Manor since 1990 and in April it
moved into a new phase of its development with the setting up of a company
limited-by-guarantee with the University.  Ann Petherwick, the Project Director,
encourages property owners, local authorities and housing associations to work together.
She is working closely with the University in creating student housing over shops
in the city.  In York apparently there are hundreds of potential dwellings.</p>
<p>According to Ann, the space above shops is the most undervalued housing resource in
the country.  Shelter predicts that 100,000 rentable homes will be needed every year for
the next five years and LOTS could help to find the answer.</p>
<p>Benefits the LOTS scheme could bring to York and other city centres are obvious: the
whole place would become more active in the evenings and therefore safer; it could 
bring back trade to small shopkeepers and might even mean less traffic.</p>

<p>Another LOTS scheme, mentioned in the July 1996 <i>University Magazine</i>.  The
site, near Micklegate Bar, to accomodate 20 students.  See <a href="#latest">latest news</a>.</p>

<h2>    <a name="walm">Walmgate</a></h2>

<p>Another new-for-1996 property, see below.</p>

<h2>	<a name="latest">Latest News</a></h2>

<p>This from the <i>University Magazine</i>, October 1996:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>LOTS more accommodation</strong></p>
<p>The Living Over The Shop project took another step forward this month
with the completeion of three further schemes.  This will increase
the total of students housed in York under the scheme from 26 to over
80.</p>
<p>The properties are at 1-3 South Parade (opposite the Odeon in
Blossom Street), 65/67 Fulford Road - where the shops are being utilised
in addition to the upper floors, and 50-54 Walmgate.  All will provide
good standard accommodation in interesting buildings, and the Walmgate
property is the first to be completed within the city walls.</p>
<p>The LOTS office is already working on eight further schemes for 1996/7,
some of which may be available for the start of the January term.  It is
hoped to extend the range of housing provided to create some self-contained
accommodation, either in the form of one-bed flats or studio flats.  This
would be particularly attractive to postgraduates, but LOTS is also 
looking at the possibility of creating some housing for newly-arrived
members of staff.</p>
